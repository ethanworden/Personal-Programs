# Personal-Programs
These are programs that I have made/worked with throughout my time at Saint Martin's University.
The classes involved are Intro to Programming, Intermediate Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as additional classes that I sat in which were MSSA courses. All Programs are in C#
